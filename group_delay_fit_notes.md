# Envelope group-delay equalizer — fitting notes

Source data: `SallenKey_LP_filter_BC337.txt` (LTspice AC sweep of the actual
original 2-pole Sallen-Key RSET reconstruction filter circuit, including the
BC337 buffer stage — not an idealized 2-pole formula).

## Method

1. Parsed the sweep's magnitude (dB) and phase (degrees) vs frequency.
2. Built a cubic spline of unwrapped phase vs frequency and differentiated
   it analytically to get group delay: `tau(f) = -(1/2*pi) * dphi/df`.
   Cross-checked against raw central-difference derivatives on the sweep's
   own (non-uniform, ~10 points/decade) frequency points — agreement within
   ~0.02us in-band, ~0.2us worst case near 3.2kHz. The spline is fit only
   over 100Hz-20kHz (the sweep's own phase reverses direction above ~65kHz,
   an artifact of the transistor buffer stage's own high-frequency rolloff,
   irrelevant to the audio band and excluded from the fit).
3. Fit two cascaded first-order digital all-pass sections (`ssb_allpass1_t`,
   Fs=10000Hz to match `SAMPLE_RATE_HZ`) by minimizing the peak-to-peak
   spread of (analog + digital) combined group delay over a dense grid from
   100-4300Hz (covers the 700/1900Hz two-tone fundamentals, the 1200Hz beat
   and its harmonics through the 4th, and the +4300Hz 5th-order IMD
   product), using Nelder-Mead (multiple starting points, all converged to
   the same optimum).

## Result

| | Peak-to-peak dispersion, 100-4300Hz |
|---|---|
| Analog filter alone | 29.8us |
| Best possible with **one** all-pass section | 19.2us (barely better — the analog curve is non-monotonic, one section can't match that shape) |
| **Two** sections, `a1=0.194594`, `a2=-0.136698` | **0.85us** |
| (for reference: the Bessel filter redesign, measured on real hardware) | 2.7us |

Mean combined delay after equalization: ~265us (2.65 samples @ 10kHz) — up
from ~66-78us analog-alone, because an all-pass filter can only add delay,
never remove it. The phase/envelope relative-delay line
(`s_relative_delay_samples`) needs to be re-tuned from roughly **+2.65
samples** once this is enabled, a different regime from the Bessel filter's
-0.20 to -0.25 samples.

See `group_delay_equalizer_fit.png` for the delay-vs-frequency plot.

## Status

Numerically fit against simulated (LTspice) data only — **not yet validated
on real hardware**. Implemented as `ssb_allpass1_t` in `ssb_dsp.h`/`.c`
(generic reusable primitive) and instantiated with these coefficients in
`ssb_mic_test.ino`, toggled via serial command `g`. Recommended validation
path: `p` (envelope step test) with `g` off/on on a scope first (cleaner
step edge = working), then real two-tone/spectrum-analyzer testing after
re-tuning `[`/`]`.

## 2026-08-16 refit: SAMPLE_RATE_HZ raised to 16000

Once the AD9851 write path was rewritten to bit-bang (see `AD9851.c`),
`SAMPLE_RATE_HZ` was raised from 10000 to 16000 (see `config.h`'s header
comment). All-pass coefficients don't rescale proportionally with Fs, so
this fit was re-run at Fs=16000 — same source data
(`SallenKey_LP_filter_BC337.txt`), same method (steps 1-3 above,
unchanged), same 100-4300Hz fit grid (that's an absolute-Hz criterion
covering the two-tone fundamentals/beat/IMD product, unrelated to Fs), only
`Fs=16000` substituted into the digital all-pass group-delay formula.
Global optimum confirmed via a coarse (a1,a2) grid scan before polishing
with Nelder-Mead (multiple starts), not just taken on the first
convergence.

| | Peak-to-peak dispersion, 100-4300Hz |
|---|---|
| Analog filter alone (Fs-independent) | 29.8us |
| **Two** sections @ 10000Hz, `a1=0.194594`, `a2=-0.136698` | 0.85us (see above) |
| **Two** sections @ 16000Hz, `a1=-0.023900`, `a2=0.447131` | **14.7us** |
| (exploratory, not wired in) Three sections @ 16000Hz | 10.1us |
| (exploratory, not wired in) Four sections @ 16000Hz | 5.2us |

**Why two sections do noticeably worse at 16000Hz**: a first-order digital
all-pass section's delay-vs-frequency curve is shaped over the section's
full 0-Nyquist range. At 10000Hz the 100-4300Hz fit band spans up to
`4300/5000 = 86%` of Nyquist; at 16000Hz the same absolute Hz band only
spans `4300/8000 = 54%` of Nyquist — the same two sections have
proportionally less curvature available across that narrower fraction of
their own range, so they can't bend to match the analog filter's
non-monotonic peak as tightly. Confirmed not an optimizer-convergence
artifact (grid search found the same optimum the Nelder-Mead polish did);
confirmed it's a real structural limit of the 2-section architecture at
this Fs, not a bug. Adding a third and fourth cascaded section (cheap —
`ssb_allpass1_process` is one multiply-add per sample, and the current
[timing] budget at 16000Hz has margin to spare) recovers most of the
difference if 14.7us turns out to matter once this is validated on real
hardware; not implemented yet since it wasn't asked for.

Mean combined delay after equalization at 16000Hz: ~163.2us (2.611 samples
@ 16000Hz) — down from ~265us (2.65 samples @ 10000Hz) even though both are
"2.6-ish samples", because the coefficients themselves are different, not
because of the sample-rate conversion. `relative_delay_samples` in
`settings.h` was rescaled by the Fs ratio (1.6x) as a first-order
approximation when this change went in, but that rescale doesn't know
about this ~102us shift in the digital filter's own contribution — see
that file's header note for the expected direction of the residual
re-tuning error.
