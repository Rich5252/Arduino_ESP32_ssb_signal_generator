/**
 * config.h
 *
 * Shared compile-time configuration for the ssb_mic_test sketch. Split out
 * of ssb_mic_test.ino during the module-split refactor (the .ino was
 * getting hard to navigate at ~1900 lines) purely to collect the #defines
 * that more than one .cpp module needs in a single place - none of the
 * *values* below changed as part of that refactor. If you're hunting for a
 * define that used to live directly in the .ino, it's almost certainly
 * here now; a handful of genuinely module-private defines (ADC/PWM/DAC
 * pin & peripheral config, isolation-test-specific tuning that only one
 * .cpp touches) moved into that module's own header instead - see
 * adc_capture.h, envelope_output.h, carrier_output.h, relative_delay.h,
 * envelope_gdeq.h.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: include this before any other project header in every
 * translation unit that references AD9851_ATTACHED, PWM_COMPARISON_ENABLED,
 * etc. - several of those gate #if blocks in OTHER headers (in particular,
 * PWM_COMPARISON_ENABLED must be defined before "driver/ledc.h" is
 * included anywhere, same constraint the original .ino had; SDM_COMPARISON_
 * ENABLED below has the identical constraint against "driver/sdm.h").

// activity onto the GPIO13 pad, independent of any code touching that pin.
// Flip this to 0 (with the source in a mode that doesn't need the mic -
// two-tone or chirp) and rescope the affected pin: if the 5kHz pulse
// disappears, that confirms the ADC driver as the source rather than some

// fire from REAL ISR context, unlike TIMING_DEBUG_GPIO above which only
// ever toggles from dsp_task, a task context) - purely diagnostic,
// intended to be scoped ALONGSIDE TIMING_DEBUG_GPIO to localize where the
// [timing] wakeup-jitter figure actually originates:
//   - rock-solid periodic on GPIO_ISR, jitter only shows up on
//     TIMING_DEBUG_GPIO -> the jitter is purely in the cross-core
//     notify/hand-off from gptimer's ISR (Core 1) to dsp_task (Core 0).
//     TRIED co-locating them on Core 1 instead to eliminate this hand-off
//     entirely (see the .ino's dsp_task creation site) - real hardware
//     starved Serial completely, reverted; root cause not yet understood,
//     so this hand-off is still live and still the leading jitter suspect.
//   - GPIO_ISR itself already jitters -> something on Core 1 is delaying
//     gptimer's alarm ISR from firing promptly in the first place, and
//     GPIO_ADC is there to test the leading suspect: adc_continuous's own
//     on_conv_done ISR (also Core 1, firing every ADC_CONT_FRAME_SAMPLES/
//     ADC_CONT_SAMPLE_FREQ_HZ = 16/80000 = 200us = 5000Hz right now) -
//     correlate its edges against GPIO_ISR's jitter to test ISR-to-ISR
//     contention on Core 1 as the root cause.
// Both pulse LOW-then-HIGH once per ISR firing (clear, then immediately
// set - not a toggle/flip) so every single ISR call produces the same
// falling-then-rising edge pair and a scope triggering on either edge
// catches every firing, not just every other one. It's the EDGE timing
// that matters here, not the pulse width (which is just however long the
// two back-to-back register writes take - negligible, sub-100ns).

// adc_capture.cpp/the .ino) are only 32 bits wide and physically cover
// GPIO0-31 - `1UL << 39` doesn't address a real bit in that register at
// all, so a plain `GPIO.out_w1ts = (1UL << pin)` for any pin >= 32 silently
// does nothing (or hits the wrong pin, depending how the shift amount gets
// handled) rather than erroring at compile time. This is exactly what
// happened when CHIRP_REF_GPIO/TIMING_DEBUG_GPIO_ADC moved from pin13 to

// silently a no-op, not because anything was electrically wrong. GPIO32+
