// Worst-case timing diagnostics for dsp_task. Read/printed via

// calls on the real-time path). max_busy_us is a running high-water
// mark, never reset except via diagnostics_reset(), so it captures the
// worst case seen since boot (or since the last reset) even if it only
// happens once. overrun_count increments any sample whose processing
// took longer than one sample period - if this climbs, dsp_task is at
// risk of never yielding back to ulTaskNotifyTake, which starves IDLE0
// and trips the task watchdog.
//
// Called once per dsp_task tick, right after ulTaskNotifyTake() returns -
// updates the tick counter and the wake-up jitter stats (gap since the
// previous tick's t_start_us).

// t_start_us) - a fuller version briefly existed that also correlated
// this against ulTaskNotifyTake()'s elapsed-count return value (a
// diagnostics_record_elapsed_fast_ticks() sibling function, called on
// every wake to catch coalescing/missed wakes), but real hardware showed
// a regression in pin5's own period/pulse-width after that diagnostics
// work was added, and reverting the NEXT layer added on top of it
// (a per-wake residual-lateness measurement) did NOT fix it - so this
// whole layer is backed out down to the last confirmed-good checkpoint
// (the intr_priority=3 fix on its own, before any of this) to test
// whether ANY of it was the actual cause, rather than continuing to
// guess which specific piece. If pin5 comes back clean at THIS
// checkpoint, re-add the elapsed-count tracking piece by piece; if it's

// - the question here is which of these is eating the most total time,
// not what any single call's worst case was.
//
// delay_us matters more than it looks: the very first version of this

// 1%, "other"=96.2%) looked like Core 1 was almost completely saturated

// vTaskList()-found rogue task (there wasn't one - see the 'L' serial
// command's task list, which came back with exactly the expected 8
// tasks and nothing resembling an Arduino "events" task, since this
// project never touches WiFi/BT and that task is only ever created
// lazily by the code paths that do). delay(10) SHOULD dominate every
// loop() iteration - it's the only other thing loop() does - so
// bracketing it directly should collapse "other" down near zero and
// show that the real idle time was there all along; the [core1] idle
// hook reading just wasn't seeing most of it (see core1_idle_hook()'s

// it is NOT what the jump log's near_null classification uses.
//
// envelope_at_freq_time (2026-09-12, same day, CORRECTION): the jump log's
// first bench result (503384 events, 0% near_null, at relative_delay=+4.60)
// exposed a real bug in using delayed_envelope for that classification -
// see relative_delay_apply()'s declaration comment (relative_delay.h) for
// why delayed_envelope isn't time-matched to delayed_freq_dev_hz once
// delay is large. envelope_at_freq_time IS time-matched (always read at
// the same lag freq_dev_hz was), and is what the near_null flag/trace/log
// below now use instead.
//
// envelope_at_freq_time_min (2026-09-12, later same day): the SECOND real
// bench capture (delay=+0.90, 25693 events, 25% near_null, a clean
// repeating 3-state cycle where only 1 of the 3 states classified
// near_null) exposed a further subtlety - at a lopsided fractional delay,
// the blended envelope_at_freq_time can miss a near-null RAW sample that
// only got a small minority weight in the interpolation. This is the
// smaller of the two raw samples that blend actually mixes together - see
// relative_delay_apply()'s declaration comment for the full reasoning.
// Used for a SECOND, more permissive near_null_either flag alongside the
// original (now near_null_blended) one, so both questions - "was the
// transmitted result near a null" and "did anything near a null
// contribute to it at all" - are answered per event, not just one.
//
// raw_freq_dev_near/_far (2026-09-12, later same day): the two RAW,
// undelayed freq_dev_hz ring values that interp_ring() blended together to
// produce delayed_freq_dev_hz - see relative_delay_apply()'s declaration
// comment (relative_delay.h) for the full reasoning. Added after a
// delay=+4.28 capture (134573 events, 2% near_null_blended, 34%
// near_null_either) decoded into a clean repeating 3-state cycle where 2
// of the 3 transitions had a near-null contributor caught only by the
// more permissive near_null_either test, but the THIRD and LARGEST
// transition (~5761Hz) showed no near-null involvement by either test.
// These two raw values answer the next question before jumping to "so
// there's a null-independent mechanism": do the two individual,
// undelayed samples already differ by roughly the logged step size (a
// real discontinuity exists in the raw signal itself, just not one an
// envelope-near-null test happens to flag), or are they both
// individually unremarkable (meaning the large DELAYED step is an
// interpolation artifact from blending across a multi-sample lag during
// a fast-changing part of the waveform, not evidence of any discrete
// event at all)? Logged and printed alongside the rest of the jump-log
// entry, not used for any near_null classification of their own.
// raw_freq_dev_current/raw_envelope_current (2026-09-16, later still): this
// tick's own freq_dev_hz/envelope EXACTLY as ssb_dsp_process_sample() (or
// the isolation-test modes) produced them - before envelope_floor/gdeq/
// ampeq/predistort/the PWM offset-scale mapping reshape `envelope`, and
// before relative_delay_apply() re-times either one. Added specifically to
// build a second, correctly-paired energy-weighted fast EMA alongside the
// existing one (see s_freq_ema_energy_num_fast's declaration comment,
// diagnostics.cpp): a same-instant cross-check against ssb_dsp.c's own
// already-validated env2_dphi_sum/env2_sum accumulator
// (log_20260916_212424.txt) showed that accumulator - which pairs envelope
// with dphi at the exact same raw tick - stays stable within a few Hz while
// the existing fast EMA (which pairs delayed_freq_dev_hz with the SHAPED
// envelope_at_freq_time) swings by 80+Hz between consecutive readings on an
// unchanging bench setup. These two raw values let a second fast EMA use
// the same raw-tick pairing ssb_dsp.c's own validated accumulator does,
// without waiting on that accumulator's own lifetime-averaged (slow-to-
// respond) convergence. Two known simplifications, not yet resolved:
// (1) this pairing is deliberately PRE-delay (matching ssb_dsp.c's own
// choice) rather than routed through relative_delay's ring the way the
// existing envelope_at_freq_time-based EMA is - correct at delay=0,
// an approximation otherwise, though relative_delay's typical values (a
// few samples) are small next to a full null-crossing width; (2)
// raw_freq_dev_current is this function's OUTPUT freq_dev_hz - already
// past ssb_dsp_process_sample()'s own slew-limit/clamp/LSB-sign-flip,
// unlike the true pre-clamp dphi ssb_dsp.c's own accumulator uses - a
// difference that should only matter on the rare tick where that clamp

// 'J' fires on every beat-null crossing - hundreds to thousands of times
// a second, per the captures in moving_forward_notes.md/
// null_bias_investigation.md's 2026-09-12 entries - so by the time a
// human reacts to an observed shift and reads 'J', its ring has wrapped
// many times over with unrelated routine churn; a capture taken
// deliberately right after Aux SP showed a real 1000->962Hz shift came
// back showing the exact same 3-state cycle as every "nothing happened"
// capture before it, carrying no signal at all about when the
// human-perceptible shift actually occurred.
//
// This instead tracks a fast/slow EMA pair of delayed_freq_dev_hz (fast
// tau long enough to average out one beat-null cycle several times over;
// slow tau ~2s, lagging behind as "where this has been sitting") and
// LATCHES a coarse, before-and-after binned trace the moment they diverge
// by more than SLOW_JUMP_TRIGGER_HZ (diagnostics.cpp) - calibrated to the
// user's own independently-reported +/-5Hz visual-read tolerance on Aux
// SP, not a DSP-internal number, i.e. tuned to "would a human watching
// the display actually see this." Prints a live "still watching"
// fast/slow/delta readout if nothing has triggered yet, or the full
// latched pre/post trace if it has, then re-arms (and resyncs the slow
// EMA to the fast one, to avoid an immediate re-trigger storm while the
// slow EMA is still catching up) so the next event isn't missed while
// this one's being read. Only ever called from Core 1's
// handle_serial_commands() context - see diagnostics.cpp for format.
//
// 2026-09-15: a latched trace no longer strictly needs this keypress to be
// read - diagnostics_service() now also drains a LATCHED trace on its own,
// every loop() iteration, printing the identical trace with an
// "AUTO-CAPTURED" header instead of "TRIGGERED" (see
// diagnostics_check_slow_trace_auto_dump(), file-local to diagnostics.cpp,
// for the full rationale: leaving a bench run unattended and letting hard-
// to-catch hands-off jumps land in the serial log by themselves). This
// function's own live "still watching" readout is unaffected and remains

void diagnostics_print_slow_trace(void);

// 2026-09-15: 'H' serial command - a second, independent detector alongside

// the actual transmitted frequency on an SDR and reporting cases where it
// jumps and then SITS at the new value for a long time (their own example:
// "-22Hz, been there a while") - which 'K' can't reliably see, because 'K'
// only fires on FAST-vs-SLOW divergence and its own re-arm resyncs slow to
// fast every time it's read. If fast and slow ever drift together slowly
// enough to never re-open a gap between EACH OTHER, 'K' goes silent even
// while sitting far from where the run actually started.
//
// This instead compares the fast EMA against a PERMANENT anchor - snapped
// once from fast at the same boot-settle instant 'K's slow EMA gets its own
// one-time snap, and never touched again - so a genuine sustained
// departure from where this run settled is visible no matter how gradually
// it got there. Fires a "CONFIRMED STUCK" print (plus a dump of an always-
// running rolling trace of the actual tx_freq/fast_hz, coarse - 2
// samples/sec over the last 60s - specifically so it isn't fooled by an
// SDR/FFT display's own exponential-average "trail" the way a fine
// per-tick trace might invite comparison against) once the deviation has
// been continuous for at least HELD_MIN_DURATION_MS (diagnostics.cpp,
// currently 15s - well past how long this session's own data shows an
// ordinary reverting 'K'-style jump actually lasts, so this doesn't just
// re-detect the same routine cycles 'K' already catches), a periodic
// "still stuck" heartbeat every HELD_REANNOUNCE_MS while it remains so,
// and a "RECOVERED" print with total duration once it clears. Auto-prints
// on its own from diagnostics_service() exactly like 'K's auto-dump (see
// diagnostics_check_held_freq(), file-local to diagnostics.cpp) - 'H'
// itself is a manual, on-demand, non-destructive status/trace read (no
// re-arm needed - the anchor is permanent and the rolling trace always
// runs regardless of whether anyone reads it).
//
// 2026-09-15, later same day: every line this prints (and every auto-fired
// CONFIRMED STUCK/still-stuck/RECOVERED line) now carries an explicit
// t=%ums, directly comparable to a 'K' trace's own "at t=%ums" - added
// after a live case where it mattered whether an 'H' read genuinely showed
// nothing during a real sustained jump, or was just read too long after
