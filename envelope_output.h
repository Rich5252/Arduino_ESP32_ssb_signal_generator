/**
 * envelope_output.h
 *
 * Everything that turns the computed envelope into an actual analog
 * signal: the LEDC/RC "PWM comparison" path (RSET modulation via a
 * BS170 gate), the MCP4725 I2C DAC path (currently disconnected
 * hardware, kept for side-by-side comparison), and (2026-09-08) a third
 * SDM (Sigma-Delta Modulation) comparison path, plus the envelope-to-PWM-
 * duty range mapping knobs ('u'/'j'/'i'/'k').
 *
 * Why a DAC instead of PWM+RC filter: at a -70dBc spurious target, a
 * switched (PWM) envelope needs either an impractically high switching
 * frequency or a multi-pole filter to get there on filter math alone, and
 * in practice parasitic coupling of the switching edges tends to dominate
 * at that level regardless of filter order. A true DAC output has no
 * switching-frequency energy to suppress in the first place.
 *
 * PWM_COMPARISON_ENABLED (config.h) adds the old LEDC+RC path back in,
 * driven from the same envelope value as the DAC, purely so the two can
 * be scoped side by side against the same source signal. Set to 0 once
 * you're done comparing.
 *
 * Why SDM, and why now: the whole PWM interpolation investigation
 * (pwm_envelope_interpolation_report.md) found two independent write-
 * rate-related noise costs baked into the LEDC peripheral (a wake-rate/
 * CPU-margin cost and a hardware-fade-engine-inherent cost), neither
 * fixed by any of five architectures tried. SDM is architecturally
 * different: its 1-bit output free-runs continuously at its own internal
 * comparator rate (SDM_SAMPLE_RATE_HZ below), decoupled from how often
 * software updates the target density - in principle sidestepping both
 * costs with a single plain register write per real (16kHz) dsp_task
 * tick, no interpolation architecture needed. It was set aside earlier
 * (2026-09-08) over its 8-bit signed resolution (vs. LEDC's 10-bit duty)
 * given this project's prior linearity/resolution battles - being tried
 * anyway now because the only way to really settle it is on the bench.
 * SDM_COMPARISON_ENABLED (config.h) gates this path; off by default,
 * not yet bench-verified in any form.

// ENABLED and SDM_COMPARISON_ENABLED must never both be 1 at the same time
// now that they share a pin - ledc_channel_config() and sdm_new_channel()
// would both try to route this same GPIO through the GPIO matrix to two
// different peripherals, which is a real conflict (undefined which one

// branching - this path always writes the freshest full-tick value
// directly, completely independent of whatever interpolation the PWM leg

// safe) to try to shave the ~1dB IMD gap this single-function version
// measured against the best PWM/RC result, on the theory that dsp_task's
// own cross-core wake/scheduling latency was adding jitter to the write.
// REVERTED - real hardware came back WORSE (another ~1dB down, close-in
// jitter still present or worse), not better. Two suspected reasons, not
// mutually exclusive, both amounting to "the ISR became less
// trustworthy, not more": (1) sdm_channel_set_pulse_density()'s IRAM
// residency is gated by a separate Kconfig option
// (CONFIG_SDM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM) this project has no way to confirm is
// set in the installed Arduino-ESP32 core - if it isn't, that call is
// FLASH-resident, and calling flash-resident code from inside the
// project's single highest-priority ISR risks exactly the kind of cache-
// line stall this project already found and fixed once before (dac_task's
// I2C driver activity on Core 1 - see dsp_task's own IRAM_ATTR comment,
// ssb_mic_test.ino), except now inside the ISR itself, which also delays
// the vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR() call right after it - compounding rather
// than just adding. (2) the stage happens LATE in dsp_task's own per-tick
// work (after the full ADC/Hilbert/gdeq/ampeq/predistort/relative-delay
// chain - see the .ino's own "PWM write goes FIRST... before the AD9851
// SPI transfer" comment for why it's placed there), i.e. at the point in
// the tick where dsp_task's own accumulated timing variance is largest;
// if dsp_task ever finishes late enough to spill past the NEXT tick's
// alarm (a real, already-documented possibility - see dsp_task's own
// elapsed_fast_ticks/coalescing-fix comment), the ISR at that next tick
// commits a value stale by MORE than the intended one tick, an irregular
// hiccup rather than the clean fixed delay the design assumed. Full
// writeup: group_delay_fit_notes.md's matching entry. Reverted to this
// single synchronous function - real hardware evidence beats the
// theoretical benefit here, same standing project convention as
// everywhere else this happened (v5 hardware fade, the ENVELOPE_INTERP_
