 *
 * v4: folded into dsp_task's own fast tick, no ISR/task/timer/LEDC-fade of
 * our own left in this file at all - see header comment for the three
 * prior versions this replaced and why each failed on real hardware.
 *
 * v4.1: step-COUNTED ramp -> time-BASED ramp (see on_full_tick()/
 * on_interp_tick() and compute_ramp_value() below) - fixes real,
 * structural jitter found on hardware even after the notification-
 * coalescing fix. See envelope_interp.h for the full explanation.
 *
 * v4.2: straight-line ramp -> Catmull-Rom / cubic Hermite curve. Only the
 * CURVE compute_ramp_value() evaluates changed - the time-accurate frac
 * derivation from v4.1 is untouched. See envelope_interp.h for the
 * simulation results and latency tradeoff behind this.
 *
 * v4.3: curve made runtime-switchable (linear vs. Catmull-Rom), for a
 * direct A/B on real hardware - see envelope_interp.h's "v4.3" header note
 * for the full rationale, including why this deliberately keeps v4.2's
 * data window/timing identical for both curve choices rather than
 * reverting "linear" mode to v4's original narrower one.
 *
 * v4.4: added a third curve, HOLD - plain zero-order-hold at the fast-tick
 * (64kHz) rate, no ramp at all, zero added latency. Isolates a DIFFERENT
 * question than v4.3's LINEAR-vs-CATMULL_ROM did: does writing the LEDC
 * duty register 4x more often matter AT ALL, independent of what shape (if
 * any) is written - see envelope_interp.h's "v4.4" header note.
