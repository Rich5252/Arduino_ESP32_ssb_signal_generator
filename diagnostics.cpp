// is exactly the user's own engineering doubt (moving_forward_notes.md,
// 2026-09-12: "I still have my engineering doubts that this is the only
// problem"). This keeps the last JUMP_LOG_LEN qualifying events (a lower,
// more inclusive bar than "new all-time record" - JUMP_LOG_THRESHOLD_HZ),
// each stamped with enough context to be judged individually rather than
// argued about in aggregate:
//   - envelope: envelope_at_freq_time (relative_delay.h/.cpp) - the
//     envelope value from the SAME original sample time as the (possibly
//     delayed) freq_dev value that produced this tx_freq step. 2026-09-12
//     CORRECTION, same day: this field originally used delayed_envelope
//     instead - the POST-delay envelope - reasoning that "was this
//     near-null AT THE MOMENT OF TRANSMISSION" was the physically relevant
//     question (per the relative_delay/near-null-spike interaction in
//     null_bias_investigation.md's earlier 2026-09-12 entry). That
//     reasoning was wrong in one specific way: for delay>0 (every two-tone
//     preset), envelope itself is read at zero lag inside
//     relative_delay_apply() (env_back=0), so delayed_envelope is just the
//     CURRENT tick's envelope - NOT time-matched to the freq_dev value
//     that got delayed. At large delay this can badly misclassify a
//     genuine null-crossing event as near_null=false, since the envelope
//     being compared against is from the wrong moment entirely. The very
//     first bench capture with this log (relative_delay=+4.60,
//     503384 events, 0% near_null) is likely exactly this failure mode,
//     not proof of a second mechanism - see moving_forward_notes.md's
//     2026-09-12 entry for the full reasoning and what would distinguish
//     the two.
//   - relative_delay_samples: current delay setting - lets a delay sweep
//     be correlated against jump occurrence directly, firmware-side,
//     instead of only inferring it from Aux SP behavior.
//   - busy_us: this tick's own DSP busy time - a timing-domain cause (the
//     Core-1-serial-bleed-into-Core-0 mechanism already root-caused twice
//     in this project's history) would show up here directly, as an
//     anomalous busy_us coinciding with the jump.
//   - audio_source: settles "does this also happen on mic input, not just
//     the perfectly-periodic two-tone test signal" without a separate
//     experiment - just leave 'J' logging running across a source change
//     and compare counts.
//   - near_null: envelope < ssb_dsp_get_null_bias_threshold() at capture -
//     the single most direct test of the null-crossing hypothesis. If the
//     near-null percentage across many logged events stays near 100%, that's
//     strong, repeated (not anecdotal) support for the existing theory. If a
//     meaningful fraction of events come back near_null=false, that's
//     direct, hard evidence of a SEPARATE mechanism at work.

// 2026-09-12 entries), so by the time a human reacts to an observed
// frequency shift and reads 'J', the ring has wrapped many times over
// with unrelated routine churn. Direct confirmation, not just theory: a
// capture taken deliberately right after Aux SP showed a real 1000->962Hz
// shift came back showing the EXACT SAME 3-state cycle, same values, as
// every "nothing happened" capture before it - the low-level log carries
// no signal at all about when a human-perceptible shift occurred, because

// 2026-09-12, yet later still: FIRST REAL 'K' CAPTURE turned out to be a
// false positive, caused by the EMA seeding itself, not a real event -
// before=697.40Hz after=704.63Hz (delta=+7.23Hz) with only 3 pre-bins
// filled (i.e. this fired within ~4ms of boot/reset) and a post-trace
// showing the exact same repeating cycle (800/800/800/400Hz, period 4
// bins) both before AND after the "trigger," with no visible transition
// anywhere in it. Root cause: both EMAs seed from a single RAW
// (unaveraged) sample on the very first tick - if that sample happens to
// land on one extreme of the ongoing periodic churn (800Hz here, not the
// cycle's ~700Hz time-average), the FAST EMA (tau=50ms) converges toward
// the true average within tens of ms while the SLOW EMA (tau=2s) is still
// sitting almost exactly at the biased seed value - diverging by more
// than SLOW_JUMP_TRIGGER_HZ almost immediately, from initialization bias
// alone, regardless of whether anything real happened. A resync at re-arm
// (diagnostics_print_slow_trace()) has the same exposure in miniature -
// the fast EMA it snaps the slow one to is itself only tau=50ms smoothed,
// so it can still be offset from the true multi-second average right
// after a busy cycle.
//
// FIRST FIX ATTEMPT (an 8s, ~4x-slow-tau warm-up hold on the trigger
// check) turned out to be UNDERSIZED, not wrong in kind - a follow-up
// capture at t=9239ms (i.e. AFTER that 8s hold had already lifted) still
// fired, and its new TREND block (added for exactly this reason) showed
// why directly: `fast` was already rock-steady at 699.07-699.08Hz for the
// entire visible 2s history, while `slow` was still climbing smoothly and
// monotonically (666.23 -> 687.31Hz over that same 2s, a textbook
// exponential settling curve) - i.e. still visibly converging from its
// boot seed value nearly 9.2s in. Extrapolating that curve back
// implies a seed value hundreds to over a thousand Hz away from the true
// ~699Hz average - entirely plausible given this project's own
// well-documented near-null freq_dev spikes (thousands of Hz, see the
// 'J' captures elsewhere in this file) landing on the single raw sample
// used to seed both EMAs. The "4 tau -> ~98% converged" heuristic behind
// the original 8s figure assumed a "reasonably-sized" initial error - it
// doesn't hold when the seed itself can be a thousand-Hz outlier, where
// even a small residual PERCENTAGE is still tens of Hz.
//
// REAL fix: stop seeding the slow EMA from a raw sample at all. Seed only
// the FAST EMA that way (its own short tau, ~50ms, makes it converge to
// the true running average almost immediately regardless of what the
// seed was), let it run alone for FREQ_EMA_BOOT_SETTLE_MS (~10x its own
// tau - by then it's converged from even a large seed error to within a
// small fraction of a percent), THEN snap slow = fast's already-converged
// value - never seeding slow from a potentially-extreme raw sample in the
// first place, rather than trying to out-wait an error whose size was
// never bounded to begin with. A short residual FREQ_EMA_WARMUP_MS hold
// on the trigger check remains afterward, purely as insurance (e.g.
// against the snap instant itself landing mid-spike) - now starting from
// an already-good value instead of a raw one, so it only needs to cover

// genuine 8-11Hz fast/slow EMA gap having triggered them. If the signal
// were truly unchanging for as long as it's been running, a periodic
// waveform this regular (both EMAs' cutoffs sit far below the ~200Hz
// cycle-repeat rate) should long since have pulled BOTH EMAs to within
// a fraction of a Hz of the true periodic mean - an 8-11Hz gap that
// persists despite a locally flat 100ms window is best explained by a

// 2026-09-15: 'H' - a second, independent detector alongside the slow_trace
// ('K') one above, built after the user pointed out a real gap in that
// design: they're watching the ACTUAL output on an SDR and reporting cases
// where it visibly jumps and then SITS at the new frequency for a long
// time (their own example: "-22Hz, been there a while") - and 'K' can't
// reliably see this. 'K' only fires on FAST-vs-SLOW divergence, and its
// own re-arm deliberately resyncs slow to fast every time a trace is read
// (see print_and_rearm_slow_trace()'s own comment for why - avoiding a
// re-trigger storm). That means if fast and slow ever drift down TOGETHER
// slowly enough to never re-open a 5Hz gap between EACH OTHER, 'K' goes
// completely silent - even while sitting at a value far from where this
// whole run actually started, for as long as that lasts. This can't be
// fixed by tuning 'K' - it needs a comparison against something that
// never gets resynced.
//
// s_freq_anchor_hz is that something: a single fixed reference, snapped
// ONCE from the fast EMA at the exact same instant 'K's own slow EMA gets
// its one-time boot-settle snap (see FREQ_EMA_BOOT_SETTLE_TICKS above) -
// i.e. "where this run's signal actually settled once fully warmed up" -
// and then NEVER touched again for the rest of the boot, unlike slow_hz
// which resyncs on every 'K' read. Comparing the fast EMA against this
// permanent anchor, rather than against the self-resyncing slow EMA,
// answers a genuinely different question: not "did anything just change"
// (K's job) but "is the output currently sitting somewhere different from
// where it started, and has it been there a while" - exactly what the
// user is asking to detect.
//
// HELD_TRIGGER_HZ, 2026-09-15 UPDATE (same day, before any bench build of
// this went out): originally set to 10Hz on the reasoning that a bigger
// bar than SLOW_JUMP_TRIGGER_HZ (5Hz) would help keep this from re-firing
// on ordinary K-style jump-then-revert cycles. That reasoning turned out
// to be solving the wrong half of the problem - the very next real-world
// report the user sent ("-13 to +8, still sitting at +8") describes a
// held state at only ~8Hz off nominal, which a 10Hz bar would have missed
// entirely, defeating the whole point of this detector for exactly the
// case it was built for. The actual, already-working defense against
// re-firing on ordinary reverting jumps is HELD_MIN_DURATION_MS (below) -
// those revert within single-digit seconds regardless of MAGNITUDE (see
// K_out_1/2/3.txt's bin-level evidence), so a 15s continuous-duration
// requirement already filters them out at any reasonable magnitude
// threshold. There was never a good reason for HELD_TRIGGER_HZ to be
// bigger than SLOW_JUMP_TRIGGER_HZ's own 5Hz - that number is ALREADY the
// user's own independently-established visual-read perceptual floor (see
// SLOW_JUMP_TRIGGER_HZ's own declaration comment), so reusing it directly
// here means "anything the user could actually notice, if it's still
// there 15 seconds later" - which is exactly what this detector should
// mean. Changed 10Hz -> 5Hz.
//
// Unlike the fine (1.24ms/bin) slow_trace ring, the rolling trace here
// (HELD_TRACE_LEN samples, HELD_TRACE_SAMPLE_MS apart) runs CONTINUOUSLY
// at all times (not armed/frozen around a trigger) - a small always-on
// flight recorder of the actual tx_freq (the literal integer Hz value
// sent to the AD9851 - see diagnostics_set_tx_info()'s own declaration
// comment on tx_freq being ground truth) alongside the fast EMA, coarse
// enough to cover HELD_TRACE_LEN*HELD_TRACE_SAMPLE_MS/1000 seconds of
// history - long enough to show whatever lead-up happened before a held
// event is confirmed, and (per the user's own report of seeing an actual
// multi-second SDR "trail" on some but not most jumps) coarse enough not
// to mistake normal FFT/waterfall exponential-average smoothing on their

// corrupted (RAM bit flip from ESD/RF pickup, or a stray write from an

// CARRIER_HZ constant itself (immune to RAM corruption); ftw_reciprocal is
// checked against an independent shadow copy taken once at init (see
// ad9851_get_canary()'s doc comment, AD9851.h, for why that's not a

// the SAME ungated (mute-exempt) 1000ms timer as print_null_bias_block() -
// see that call site's comment - so this keeps checking even while running
// muted for the jump hunt.
// 2026-09-09, revised same day: originally printed an [canary] OK/MISMATCH
// line every second unconditionally (see the removed history below) so it
// could be watched live while muted. That turned out to be a real mistake:
// it meant "muted" no longer actually meant silent - there was now ALWAYS
// 5 lines/sec of Serial traffic (this plus print_null_bias_block(), also
// exempted at the time) regardless of 'v', and the user reported a new
// "noisy" symptom that behaved exactly like the old unmuted-diagnostics
// noise mechanism despite 'v' genuinely being off - i.e. the fix for
// watching the canary silently had itself quietly broken "silently".
// Redesigned to be genuinely silent during normal (healthy) operation:
// canary_check_background() below is called unconditionally, every
// diagnostics_service() tick (not on any timer), but only actually prints
// the FIRST time either check transitions from OK to MISMATCH - after
// that it's a no-op forever (the transition already happened and latched;
// re-printing every tick would add back exactly the noise this rework
// exists to remove). Checking every tick rather than once a second is a
// free improvement while at it - the event gets reported with far less
// latency, since there's no cost to checking when there's nothing to print.
// canary_print_status() is the explicit "show me right now" version for

// during the silence") unnecessarily fiddly: un-muting resumes the

// request, whether muted or not, without touching last_print_ms/
// last_timing_print_ms/last_null_bias_print_ms (so it doesn't perturb any
// of the periodic blocks' own independent schedules either). Deliberately
// does NOT reset any counters - it's a read, not a `'r'`. Still goes
